Klondike-Solver
===============

Klondike (Patience) Solver that finds minimal length solutions.

    KlondikeSolver [/DC] [/D] [/G] [/O] [/M] [/S] [/F] [/R] [FilePath]
        /DRAW # [/DC #] - Sets the draw count to use when solving. Defaults to 1.
        /DECK str [/D str] - Loads the deck specified by the string.
        /GAME # [/G #] - Loads a random game with seed #.
        FilePath - Solves deals specified in the file.
        /R - Replays solution to output if one is found.
        /MOVES /MVS - Will output a compact list of moves made when a solution is found.
        /MULTI # [/M #] - Uses # threads to solve deals. Only works when solving minimally.
        /OUT # [/O #] - Sets the output method of the solver. Defaults to 0, 1 for Pysol, 2 for minimal output.
        /STATES # [/S #] - Sets the maximum number of game states to evaluate before terminating. Defaults to 5,000,000.
        /FAST [/F] - Run the solver in a best attempt mode, which is faster, but not guaranteed to give minimal solution or one at all.
        /STAT str [/ST str] - Output statistics information in a file given by str
