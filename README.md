    python main.py

# Solver

The solver used is the one from [ShootMe](https://github.com/ShootMe/Klondike-Solver), I copied it here in this repository since I planned to make some modifications to include more data to output. The code of this solver was released under the permissive MIT license, so I decided to release the python code under the same license.
